Ctrl+Shift+P brings you directly to the editor commands

Ctrl+Shift+O enables you to navigate to a specific symbol in a file

Ctrl+G enables you to navigate to a specific line in a file

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

Extensions are software add-ons that enhance the functionality of Visual Studio Code. They allow users to customize their development environment, add new features, and integrate with external services. 

Finding and Installing Extensions

Users can find extensions within VS Code or through the Extension tab.
Navigate to the "Extensions" tab on the left-hand side panel and browse or search for extensions. Once an extension is found, click the "Install" button to add it to VS Code.

Console Output: View debug messages and program output in the Debug Console.

Step Through: Execute code line by line, stepping into or over function calls.

Resume: Continue program execution from the current breakpoint.

Restart: Restart the debugging session and reload the program.
